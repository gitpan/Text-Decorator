=head1 NAME

Text::Decorator::Filter - Base class for text decorator filters

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the base class that all filters should inherit from. It provides
the all-important C<filter> method that you really don't want to
implement yourself. Instead, you should provide one of these methods:

=head2 filter_text

This should simply modify C<$_>. It's called once for each
representation, with the representation as the first parameter to the
method.

=head2 filter_node

This gets called as

	$class->filter_node($args, $node)

for every textual node, and is expected to return one or more modified
node objects.

There's also C<filter_group> which you may want to provide, which does
the same but for C<Group> objects.

=head2 filter_anynode

This is the same, but gets called for both Group and Node objects.
