Text::Decorator - Apply a chain of filters to text
    DESCRIPTION

Text::Decorator is a framework for marking up plain text into various
formats by applying a chain of filters. For instance, you might apply
a URI-finding filter which will cause URIs in text to be presented as
links if the text is exported as HTML.
